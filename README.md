# Chaturbate-Recorder-GUI (.EXE)
Chaturbate Recorder GUI for FFMpeg

Update: November 2019, chaturbate has subtly changed their stream URL (well looks like they tried to hide it)... the necessary adjustments have been made. Will upload source at a later date.

Requirements:
  *Windows only! Written and tested on Windows 10
  *FFMpeg

Instructions:
  1. Download and extract FFMpeg to a folder.
  2. Download Chaturbate Recorder.exe and place it in the FFMpeg folder.
  3. Run the exe file.
  4. Copy the URL of the model you want to record in to the GUI.
  5. Click get stream address, wait a couple of seconds, if it is successful the address will appear in the box below.
  6. Click on start FFMpeg to begin recording.

Features:
  - This was written using VB6.0, so it will natively work in windows out of the box without any ****ing around.
  - Record stream from an input URL.
  - Recordings are automatically named by the model name and the date stamp in the .\recordings folder.
  - Favourites list implemented.
  - Check for what favourites are currently online.
  - Preview stream button & functionality.
  -ffmpeg window is hidden after recording is started (you can unhide it from the running recorders screen).
  -The new video gallery will also sort all of you recordings into models and allow you to view them.

FAQS:
  - Q.Why VB6.0 and not some other curley brace language.
  A.Short answer, I am very familiar with VB and VB variants (6.0 being my favourite.)
  A.Opinionated answer, curley brace languages suck dick.
    
  - Q. The stream suddenly stopped recording?
  A. This is a GUI for FFMpeg not a recorder, the model has probably gone offline/switched to private show and thus the stream has dropped out (the stream address actually changes when this happens too). Also it does require a fairly large amount of bandwidth to stream and capture.
    
  - Q.What IDE did you use?
  A.Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
  
  - Q. Are you going to release the source code?
    A. Y̶e̶s̶,̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶n̶t̶u̶a̶l̶l̶y̶.̶.̶.̶.̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶e̶d̶.̶
    A. Yes, it is now released into the wild. Go forth and multiply.
